# Data-Science-Lifecycle-Lab
## Build a full data science lifecycle example using Kafka, PostgreSQL and kNN

Presented at the May 1, 2019 STL Big Data - Innovation, Data Engineering, Analytics Group Meetup: 
Data Engineering and the Data Science Lifecycle

https://www.meetup.com/St-Louis-Big-Data-IDEA/events/257350394/

### This is an exercise in 3 parts:

#### A. Setup and Message Production
#### B. Message Consumption and Storage
#### C. Predictive Modeling with Machine Learning

The three Jupyter notebooks found in the Lab folder can be used as a template to build your own data science lifecycle example. If you want to see my completed implementation presented at the Meetup, it can be found in the Completed folder.

Happy Learning!
